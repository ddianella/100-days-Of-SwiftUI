# Project 2. GuessTheFlag

This app I was building a guessing game that helps users learn some of the many flags of the world. In this project I learned about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps, how to build forms and sections, creating navigation views and navigation bar titles, how to store program state with the @State property wrapper, how to create user interface controls like TextField and Picker, and how to create views in a loop using ForEach. 

## Challenge
1. Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert.
2. Show the player’s current score in a label directly below the flags.
3. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
