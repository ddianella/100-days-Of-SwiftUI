# Project 1. WeSplit

In this project I learn about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps, how to build forms and sections, creating navigation views and navigation bar titles, how to store program state with the @State property wrapper, how to create user interface controls like TextField and Picker, and how to create views in a loop using ForEach. 
This project is a check-sharing app that calculates how to split a check based on the number of people and how much tip you want to leave. 

## Challenge
1. Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
3. Change the “Number of people” picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type.
