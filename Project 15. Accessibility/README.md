# Project 15. Accessibility

I learned new tool such as Accessibility, which can be useful by people with varying access needs â€“ they might need larger text, they might need us to avoid certain colors to help them see things clearly, they might need our UI to be read out, and so on.
The main aim is that we should make all our apps accessible to everyone. I fixed some last projects and find out usability this tool.
