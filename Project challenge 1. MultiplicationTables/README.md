# Day 35: Consolidation III. MultiplicationTables
My goal was to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “What is 2 x 5?” and so on.

## Challenge:
1. The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. In my app this is pressing buttons going from 1 to 12.
2. The player should be select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, 20, or “All”.
3. MathForKids app randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.
