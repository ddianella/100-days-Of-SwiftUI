# Project 16. HotProspects
This an app to track who you meet at conferences. Youâ€™ve probably seen apps like it before: it will show a QR code that stores your attendee information, then others can scan that code to add you to their list of possible leads for later follow up.
I learned about custom environment objects, TabView, Result, objectWillChange, image interpolation, context menus, scheduling local notifications, generating and scaling up a QR code, Swift package dependencies, filter() and map() and so much more!
