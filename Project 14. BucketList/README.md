# Project 14. BucketList

In this project I built an app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later. 
To make all that work I leveraged some skills I’ve met already, such as forms, sheets, Codable, and URLSession.
I’ve covered a huge amount of ground: adding Comparable to custom types, finding the documents directory, integrating MapKit, using biometric authentication(FaceID, TouchID), secure Data writing.
