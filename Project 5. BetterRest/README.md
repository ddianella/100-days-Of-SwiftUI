# Project 5. BetterRest

BetterRest was designed to help coffee drinkers get a good nightâ€™s sleep by asking them three questions:
1) When do they want to wake up?
2) Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
3) How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?

I worked with Apple framework: Core ML. We trained our model with a CSV file, where the computer to learn how to predict how much sleep person actually need.
